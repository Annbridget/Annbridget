## 👩‍💻 About Me

I love building impactful, data-driven solutions that eliminate missed opportunities, reduce inefficiency, and replace guesswork with measurable business outcomes. I use data to drive value, efficiency, and profit, connecting three dimensions often treated as separate: business, technology, and data.

A little about me …

• The Spark:
My journey began when I realized that data is a tool for action. This led me to pursue advanced certifications in data science, machine learning, and analytics after completing my Bachelor of Education (B.Ed), setting the stage for a career focused on turning insights into impact.

• Tech Meets Business:
I bridge the gap between data science and business, ensuring insights turn into action that boosts retention, optimizes operations, and reduces costs.

• Problem-Solving Strategist:
I design solutions that deliver consistent, reliable results, whether through predictive models, real-time dashboards, or automated data pipelines.

•Data Storyteller:
Data only matters when it tells a story people can act on. Using Python, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, I transform numbers into decisions and results that guide leaders and teams.

• Machine Learning Enthusiast:
I develop models with Python, Scikit-learn, and other ML frameworks that uncover trends, inform strategy, reduce risk, and remain resilient against concept drift and model degradation.

• My Edge:
Data isn’t just what I do—it’s who I am. I experiment, learn, and refine my craft to ensure every project delivers meaningful, measurable impact.

• Purpose-Driven Work:
I believe data can solve real problems, uncover opportunities, and create lasting value—for organizations, communities, and people.

• Eternal Learner:
I’m obsessed with growth. From NLP and deep learning to advanced analytics techniques, I constantly evolve in a field that refuses to stand still.
